Folium Project

How it works
  > Run folium 01 test.py
  > It will ask you a series of qns via sentenceGenerator()
  > It produces a query that filters the initial csv based on those results
  > Resulting CSV gets outputted via folium
  > Access resulting folium via SGMap.html (produced after run)
  
What I want to do
  > I would like to make a method that makes Output Window
  > Asks for info in the same timespace as the query
    > If possible, implement it in the SGMap as well, but save that for later
  > Returns a text value to put in the query segment
